The Yext plugin lets you sync your menus, product lists, social network posts, and other business content from Yext to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

The Yext plugin lets you display content from the Yext Platform on your WordPress site quickly and easily.  You decide what information you would like to include, how it looks, and where it appears on your site.

**Add your business content to your site with a single shortcode**
Just as Yext publishes your business information on leading search sites, you can now display your featured products and services, menus, staff bios, and calendars on your website.  Simply choose the content you would like to include, use the provided shortcode to embed it on your site, and Yext takes care of the rest.

**Post to your website and social networks**
Have news that you would like to share on both your website and social network pages?  Use the Yext plugin to showcase posts that you create for your site and for your Yext-enabled pages on Facebook, Google+, and Foursquare.

**Automatically update your content via the Yext Platform**
As soon as you make changes to your embedded content’s data in the Yext Platform, your edits are synced to your website.  No need to recreate your edits within WordPress or get a new shortcode. 

**Customize the appearance of your embedded content to fit your brand**
You can change how your content looks as easily as you can change the content, itself.  Choose one of our pre-built themes, or select a font, text color, background color, and more to match your branding.

To use the Yext plugin, you must have an active Yext subscription.  With the Yext Local Marketing Cloud, you can update, sync, enhance, and monitor your business listings across the web.  To learn more about Yext and see how your business appears on local search sites, visit www.yext.com.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What is embedded content? =

Embedded content is an easy way to show your site’s visitors what makes your business unique.  Each instance is a module that contains information about your business or posts from your Yext-enabled social network pages.  Yext keeps your embedded content in sync with whatever changes you make in the Yext Platform, as well as with new posts that you create through Yext.

= What can I include in embedded content? =

You can include any or all of the Content Lists you have created in the Yext Platform.
Some examples of Content Lists are:
* lists of your featured products and services
* menus of the foods and drinks you offer
* lists of the professionals or staff members who work for your business
* calendars of events happening at your business
You can also use the Yext plugin to display posts that you create for your website and your Yext-enabled Facebook, Foursquare, and Google+ pages.

= How does embedded content work? =

With the Yext plugin, you choose what kind of content you would like to embed and how that content should appear on your site. When you’re done, you’ll get a shortcode that you can insert wherever you would like the content to be displayed.  After that, any changes you make to the content, either in WordPress or in the Yext Platform, will be automatically synced to your site. If you use the plugin to embed social posts, new posts will be synced to your site as you create them through Yext.

= How often can I edit embedded content? =

You can change your embedded content as often as you like.  After you confirm your changes, any edits you make will appear on your website within seconds.
